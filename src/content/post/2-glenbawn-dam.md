Glenbawn Dam has one of the largest rock-fill embankment walls in Australia, 100 metres high and 1.1 kilometres long. The main purpose of the dam is to supply water for irrigation, power generation, stock, industry and household needs in the Hunter Valley, and provide flood mitigation and environmental flows.

Unfortunately entry to the dam requires a purchased ticket, so I just walked around and took some photos.
