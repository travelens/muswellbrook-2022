Scone is an important rural centre on the New England Highway. It is known as 'The Horse Capital of Australia' and claims to be the second-largest horse breeding area in the world, after Kentucky in the United States.

The equine focus of the town is reflected in numerous ways: it is the home to the Australian Stockhorse Association; the Hunter thoroughbred breeding industry which is reputedly the second largest breeding area in the world; the district has some of the countryâ€™s longest established pony clubs; there is a thriving polo and polocrosse community; and the bronze sculpture, 'Scone Mare and Foal' by Gabriel Sterk, is prominently situated beside the highway in Elizabeth Park.

The region is also home to cattle and sheep grazing, cereal cropping, dairies and boutique wineries. The town and the district have a large number of significant historic buildings and there is real pleasure in driving around the district and admiring the huge horse studs.

We had lunch at Subway because we discovered most of the pubs and restaurants are closed over Christmas.
