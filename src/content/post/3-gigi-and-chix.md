[Gigi & Chix Bonbon Patisserie](https://www.gigichix.com.au) is a contemporary Parisian Patisserie specializing in delicious pastries. A French-inspired brunch menu is available here. There is also a selection of French desserts including handmade tarts, eclairs, entremets, macaroons and cookies.

Owner and Pastry-Creator extraordinaire Angela Joy Mason and her two young daughters, Gigi (four) and Chix (seven), spent some time living in Bordeaux, France, where a local patisserie inspired her with an open kitchen.
