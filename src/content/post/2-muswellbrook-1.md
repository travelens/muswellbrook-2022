This morning we decided to do the Muswellbrook Heritage Walk. We couldn't find a map online, so we had to kind of guess where the walk might take us.

Muswellbrook, in the heart of the Upper Hunter is a small town associated with energy, mining and agriculture.

The 4.5k walk throughout Muswellbrook CBD supposedly includes 40 different items of historical significance. Fine old buildings dating back to the mid-1800s, grand residences, community precincts – testimony to the good times and hard times; all of great importance to the development of Muswellbrook – Roads, Rail, Bureaucracy, Arts and Culture, Entertainment, Business and Community.

We started at the cemetery, and then passed through Victoria Park. Two dogs were very inquisitive and decided to follow us on the walk down the street.

We saw quite a few old buildings, including churches, hotels, pubs, the RSL, an abandoned Video EZY store, and the library.

There is a statue of a dog in the middle of the town (Blue Heeler Country). We also saw a statue of a man on a horse (Charge of the Lighthorse on Beersheba Memorial). St. Alban's heritage listed Anglican Church looks really impressive, and we saw several very long goods trains at the railway crossing on Brook St.

We decided to stop the walk halfway and walked back to the house for breakfast.
