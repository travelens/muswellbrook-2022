[Hunter Belle Dairy Co](https://www.hunterbelledairy.com) is a family owned and operated business in the
Upper Hunter Valley of NSW. Headed by husband and wife duo Jason
and Annie Chesworth, their small team at Scone handmake a wonderful
range of dairy products including cheese, milk, butter and yoghurt.

For over 100 years the Chesworth family have been milking cows along
the Hunter River in NSW. In 2009 the 6th generation dairy farmer Geoff
Chesworth and his wife Tania decided it was time to move on from
their 400 cow dairy in Denman, NSW, and into the wonderful world of
cheese. With son Jason soon joining the business, and wife Annie, the
Chesworths have put their passion for dairy to good use and created the
Hunter Belle Dairy Co. that is today.

Established in 2004 the cheese factory began as 'Hunter Belle Cheese'. In 2009 Geoff and Tania Chesworth took over the small cellar door in Muswellbrook NSW, and steadily grew increasing production and sales as well as opening a Hunter Belle Cafe and retail outlet.

As business boomed, and the second generation became more involved, the launch of Hunter Belle Cheddar by Annie and Jason Chesworth brought with it a new, larger, premises with a cheese factory established in Scone NSW in 2014. With the young couple dubbed as 'Mr and Mrs Cheese' after appearing on My Kitchen Rules in 2013, the business began to get the attention it deserved. 

With both businesses running smoothly side by side, 2017 brought the two together with the collaboration of Hunter Belle Dairy Co.
