We started off the second part of our walk after lunch by visiting the St. James' Catholic Church, which was also very impressive.

We then headed back to St. Alban's for more photos, then walked along Hunter Terrace towards the roundabout. We then explored Fitzgerald Park with Muscle Creek flowing through it. We then explored the railway station. There are some sculptures nearby here. It was fairly late in the evening when we decided to head back.
