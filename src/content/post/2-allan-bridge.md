We had to stop the car because the bridge looks like it was taken straight out of the film "Bridges of Madison County."

The Allan Bridge, located between Glenbawn and Segenhoe, is the most significant heritage bridge in the Upper Hunter Shire. It is one of five timber heritage bridges in the Shire. It was constructed in 1937, was washed away in 1955 and reconstructed at a site further downstream.

In 2021, a truck driver allegedly caused the Allan Bridge to partially collapse, after driving over the bridge in an eight tonne truck carrying a 20 tonne load of hot mix. The bridge is rated for a maximum of four tonnes and is only one of two trussed cable suspension bridges in New South Wales capable of carrying road traffic.
