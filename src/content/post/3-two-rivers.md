[Two Rivers](https://tworivers.com.au) vineyard is situated in the upper reaches of the Hunter Valley on the banks of the region’s two dominant waterways, the Hunter and Goulburn rivers which flow on the eastern and southern boundaries of the vineyard.

The ‘Custodians of the Landscape’ sandstone sculptures were carved onsite at Two Rivers in the winter of 2015 by international artist Ben Dearnley. More than 20 tonnes of stone sourced from the vineyard were used to create this unique and compelling project by Ben. His work directly references the ancient art form of stone masonry whilst reflecting the landscape here at Two Rivers. Ben says that the flowing and dynamic nature of the sculptures reflects the ever changing moods and seasons of the vineyard where growing the vines is a labour of love in tune with nature itself.

There is a lookout point that we went to, which gave good views of the vineyard.
